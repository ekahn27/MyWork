This directory contains code for some of the first 100 problems on the website
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)

This website contains varying degrees of challenging mathematical/programming
questions done. These are done purely for fun and to learn more.

This is not designed to simply give the answers to these problems, but instead
encourage others attempt them, show how I tackled these challenges and encourage
dialogue on better methods of solving these problems.
