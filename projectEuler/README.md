This directory contains code for some of the first 100 problems on the website
projectEuler.net

These are designed to be challenging mathematical/programming questions done for
fun.

This is not designed to simply give the answers to these problems, but instead
encourage others attempt them, show how I tackled these challenges and encourage
dialogue on better methods of solving these problems.
